HTML5 + Twitter Bootstrap + CSS3

An experimentation into the Twitter Bootstrap framework for my personal site. Originally the site was based in Wordpress, though currently working outside of WP to experiment more.

<strong>8/6/2012:</strong>
I used a modified version of the Boostrap Modal style to be more flexible with mobile browsers.
<pre>
@media (max-width: 480px) 
{
    .modal.fade.in {
        top: 10px;
  }
}
</pre>
<em>This gives a better mobile experience compared to the OOTB functionality.</em>
